of the past; we've come to expect that public health and modern science can conquer
all microbes. But nature is a formidable adversary.</p></blockquote>
<i>~Tom Frieden</i>

<blockquote><p>The good physician treats the disease;
the great physician treats
the patient who has the disease.</p></blockquote>
<i>~William Osler</i>

<blockquote><p>The true face of smoking is disease, death and horror - not the glamour and

<i>~David Byrne</i>

<blockquote><p>Our farmers feed the world. They are up before dawn and work till
well after sunset. They face any number of challenges they can't control,

<i>~Luther Strange</i>

<blockquote><p>The medical literature tells us that the most effective ways to reduce 
the risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and many more problems

energy in oil instead of muscles to do our work.</p></blockquote>
<i>~David Suzuki</i>

<blockquote><p>The aim of medicine is to prevent disease and prolong life, the ideal of medicine 
is to eliminate the need of a physician.</p></blockquote>
<i>~William J. Mayo</i>

<blockquote><p>The effects of unresolved trauma can be devastating. 
It can affect our habits and outlook on life, leading to addictions 
and poor decision-making. It can take a toll on our family life and 
interpersonal relationships. It can trigger real physical pain, symptoms, 
and disease. And it can lead to a range of self-destructive behaviors.</p></blockquote>
<i>~Peter A. Levine</i>

<blockquote><p>Pregnancy is not a disease. The child in the womb is 
neither a tumor nor a parasite to be destroyed.</p></blockquote>
<i>~Chris Smith</i>

<blockquote><p>The aim of medicine is to prevent disease and prolong life, the ideal of medicine
is to eliminate the need of a physician.</p></blockquote>
<i>~William J. Mayo</i>

Ron Edgeworth died of motor neurone disease.</p></blockquote>
<i>~Judith Durham</i>

<blockquote><p>Everything that used to be a sin is now a disease</p></blockquote>
<i>~Bill Maher</i>

<blockquote><p>If you look at healthcare today, it's all about disease. 
It's not about understanding wellness at all.</p></blockquote>
<i>~Leroy Hood</i>

<blockquote><p>For just a few dollars a dose, vaccines save lives and help 
reduce poverty. Unlike medical treatment, they provide a lifetime of protection from deadly
and debilitating disease. They are safe and effective. They cut healthcare and treatment costs
reduce the number of hospital visits, and ensure healthier children, families and communities.</p></blockquote>
<i>~Seth Berkley</i>

<blockquote><p>Berries are the healthiest fruit, offering potential protection 
against cancer and heart disease, boosting the immune system and acting as a guard 
for the liver and brain.</p></blockquote>
<i>~Michael Greger</i>

<blockquote><p>Vaccines don't cause autism. Vaccines, instead, prevent disease.
Vaccines have wiped out a score of formerly deadly childhood diseases. Vaccine 
skepticism has helped to bring some of those diseases back from near extinction.</p></blockquote>
<i>~Alex Pareene</i>
