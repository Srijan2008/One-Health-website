<h1>Symptoms</h1>
<p>Each infectious disease has its own specific signs and symptoms. 
General signs and symptoms common to a number of infectious diseases include:</p>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Muscle aches</li>
<li>Coughing</li>

<h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
<p>Seek medical attention if you:</p>
<li>Have been bitten by an animal</li>
<li>Are having trouble breathing</li>
<li>Have been coughing for more than a week</li>
<li>Have severe headache with fever</li>
<li>Experience a rash or swelling</li>
<li>Have unexplained or prolonged fever</li>
<li>Have sudden vision problems</li>

<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>Infectious diseases can be caused by:</p>
<li>Bacteria:- These one-cell organisms are responsible for illnesses such as strep throat, 
urinary tract infections and tuberculosis.</li>
<li>Viruses:-Even smaller than bacteria, viruses cause a multitude of diseases ranging 
from the common cold</li>
<li>Fungi:- Many skin diseases, such as ringworm and athlete's foot, are caused by fungi. 
Other types of fungi can infect your lungs or nervous system.</li>
<li>Parasites:- Malaria is caused by a tiny parasite that is transmitted by a mosquito bite. Other parasites may be
transmitted to humans from animal feces.</li>

<h2>Direct contact</h2>
<p>An easy way to catch most infectious diseases is by coming in contact with a person 
or an animal with the infection. Infectious diseases can be spread through direct contact such as:</p>

<li>Person to person.</li>
<p>Infectious diseases commonly spread through the direct transfer of bacteria, viruses 
or other germs from one person to another. This can happen when an individual with the bacterium
or virus touches, kisses, or coughs or sneezes on someone who isn't infected.
These germs can also spread through the exchange of body fluids from sexual contact. The person
who passes the germ may have no symptoms of the disease, but may simply be a carrier.</p>

<li>Animal to person</li>
<p> Being bitten or scratched by an infected animal — even a pet — can make you sick and, 
in extreme circumstances, can be fatal. Handling animal waste can be hazardous, too. For example, 
you can get a toxoplasmosis infection by scooping your cat's litter box</p>

<li>Mother to unborn child.</li>
<p> A pregnant woman may pass germs that cause infectious diseases to her unborn baby. Some germs can 
pass through the placenta or through breast milk. Germs in the vagina can also be transmitted to the baby
during birth.</p>

<h2>Indirect contact</h2>
<p>Disease-causing organisms also can be passed by indirect contact. Many germs can linger on an 
inanimate object, such as a tabletop, doorknob or faucet handle.When you touch a doorknob handled by 
someone ill with the flu or a cold, for example, you can pick up the germs he or she left behind.
If you then touch your eyes, mouth or nose before washing your hands, you may become infected.</p>

<li>Insect bites</li>
<p>Some germs rely on insect carriers — such as mosquitoes, fleas, lice or ticks — to 
move from host to host. These carriers are known as vectors. Mosquitoes can carry the malaria parasite
or West Nile virus. Deer ticks may carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.</p>

<li>Food contamination</li>
<p>Disease-causing germs can also infect you through contaminated food and water. 
This mechanism of transmission allows germs to be spread to many people through a single 
source. Escherichia coli (E. coli), for example, is a bacterium present in or on certain foods
such as undercooked hamburger or unpasteurized fruit juice.
